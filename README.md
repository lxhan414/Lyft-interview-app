# Lyft-interview-app
This is a small web application that accepts a POST request of two argument x and y to the route "/test" and returns a JASON 
object {'sum': x+y}. If the input argument is not numeric or one of the arguments is empty, it will return "Invalid input!".
The code is written in Python.
